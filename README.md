# MindAndPlay
Mind and Play is a school App development project developed by Felix Herterich, Niklas Schmiedel and Kai Karren.

<h2>Goals</h2>
We want to develop an brain trainer with quizzes, math and some simple 2D games.
Caused by the use of Phonegap we could release the current version off the App on the github page <a href="www.kaik-interactive.github.io/MindAndPlay">MindAndPlay</a> for free use in your browser.
But for now it is only possible to save your progress local. A online linked profile option to save and sync your progress is planed for the future.
